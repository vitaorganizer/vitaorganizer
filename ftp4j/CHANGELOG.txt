Version 1.7.2 - 2012/06/26

- A bug has been fixed in the download routine, handling the "502 Command
  REST not allowed by policy" message the right way.

(Thanks to Ralf Bommersbach)


Version 1.7.1 - 2012/04/12

- The FTPConnector has now a setUseSuggestedAddressForDataConnections()
  method that can be used to determinate if the connector should trust
  the address returned by the server in the response of a PASV command,
  or if it should rather connect to the same host used for the communication
  channel. Before this release, this behavior had to be set using a
  not so flexible system property. Althought the system property approach
  is still supported, now every single connector can have its own default
  behavior and the developer can change it for every single connection.
- A bug related to the auto noop timer has been fixed.
- Any call to SimpleDateFormat is now thread safe.
- Enhancements in data transfer routines, which now are compatible with a
  larger set of servers and proxies.

(Thanks to Akom and Roberto Di Vincenzo)


Version 1.7 - 2011/12/28

- A change has been made in the FTP connectors architecture.
  FTPConnector is no longer an interface: it is now an abstract class
  implementing timeout aware connections. Timeouts for connection, read and
  close operations can be set by the caller.
- A connection attempt to a remote FTP server can now be aborted
  calling the brand new abortCurrentConnectionAttempt() method in FTPClient.
- Bugfix in the HTTPTunnelConnector.

(Thanks to David Ekholm and Jose Sierra)


Version 1.6.1 - 2011/08/26

- The "502 Command REST not allowed by policy"
  and "501 REST not compatible with server
  configuration" responses to the "REST 0" command
  are no longer as errors. This extends the library
  compatibility to a greater number of server
  types.
- Each SIZE command is now preceded by a TYPE I
  command, extending the library compatibility.
- Enhancements in the remote file list routine.
- A timezone issue has been solved in UnixListParser
  and NetWareListParser.

(Thanks to Magnus Lundvall, Raphael de Bem, Joe Gerstung and Thomas Andres)


Version 1.6 - 2011/01/07

- Append to a remote file support added.
- Data transfer speed enhancements.
- FTPES is now enforced if required.

(Thanks to Jakub Stachowski and Corey Puffalt)


Version 1.5.1 - 2010/05/30

- REST command support compatibility enhanced.
- Blank lines coming from the server are now ignored.

(Thanks to Aniceto Pérez)


Version 1.5 - 2010/03/11

- MLSD command support added.
- MODE Z support added.
- Automatic NOOP on inactivity timeout added.
- The library behaviour for passive data transfers has been
  changed. The client trusts no longer the IP address returned
  by the server in response to a PASV command. The library
  now connects always to the same host name supplied for the
  initial connection. This behaviour solves many frequently
  reported NAT problems. However, the old behaviour can be
  restored, by setting to true the value of the system property
  called ftp4j.passiveDataTransfer.useSuggestedAddress.
- The HTTPTunnelConnector has been improved, and now it is
  fully HTTP 1.1 compliant.
- A date parsing bug was fixed in UnixListParser and 
  NetWareListParser components.

(Thanks to Liu Yan, Steven Luke, Roberto Bellandi and
           Alessandro Brunelli)


Version 1.4.3 - 2009/07/14

- Enhancements in download/upload error handling
- UnixListParser enhancements
- The REST command is now issued only if the server declares
  explicitly its support in the FEAT command response

(Thanks to Stephan Fudeus and Andreas Rudolph)


Version 1.4.2 - 2009/06/01

- In FTPS and FTPES mode the client now issues a "PBSZ 0" command
  before sending the "PROT P" one. Some servers require it.
- Minor API change: the streamLength information is no more required
  by the upload method.

(Thanks to Lukas Loehrer)


Version 1.4.1 - 2009/05/20

- Bug resolved: append instead overwrite on download
- Bug resolved: blank files in textual mode on upload/download


Version 1.4 - 2009/05/18

- FTPS and FTPES support added
- New connection architecture, classes FTPConnection and SSLConnector
  have been removed


Version 1.3.3 - 2009/04/29

(Thanks to Giuseppe Baccini)


Version 1.3.1 - 2008/11/16

- Bugfix in upload routine

(Thanks to Tobias Burggraf)


Version 1.3 - 2008/11/05

- Active and passive connection modes improved for larger server
  compatibility.
- System properties support added for more customizable active
  transfer modes.
- Auto NOOP during data transfers is now disabled by default.
  The ftp4j.dataTransfer.autoNOOPDelay system property can be
  used to enable the feature (see manual).
- SSLConnector improved
- Bugfix in the automatic transfer type detection routine.

(Thanks to Marco Bascetta)
